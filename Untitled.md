Hello,

I can provide the raw HTTP request as an attachment. However, please note that the section became inaccessible after my first vulnerability was triaged, and all vulnerabilities in that area appear to have been patched.

The raw request will show the endpoint and parameters I used, but the vulnerability is now fixed so it won't be reproducible. The POC videos I submitted demonstrate that the vulnerability was valid and exploitable at the time of testing.

I'll attach the raw request for your review.

Thank you.
