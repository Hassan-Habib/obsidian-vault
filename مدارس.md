**Issue Description:**

The response behavior is completely random and inconsistent. While most responses contain no sensitive data, sensitive information is occasionally leaked without any apparent pattern.

**Evidence:**

As demonstrated in the attached video `1st-random.webm` (16.8 MB), I tested three separate chats with identical empty inputs:

- **Chat 1 & 2:** Returned responses with no sensitive data
- **Chat 3:** Leaked sensitive data

**Key Observations:**

1. All three chats had identical conditions (empty input)
2. The presence of sensitive data in responses appears to be non-deterministic
3. Even when sensitive data is leaked, the specific data returned varies between attempts
4. There is no identifiable pattern or trigger for when the leak occurs
