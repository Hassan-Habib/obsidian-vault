Got it ✅ — I’ll create a professional **bug bounty–style vulnerability report** for you, based on the leaked staging data and both IDOR issues (booking + trip info leakage).  
I’ll make it in a structured format (ready for HackerOne/Bugcrowd or email disclosure).

# Vulnerability Report – IDOR in TripActions/Navan API

**Title:**  
IDOR allows creating bookings for other users & reading sensitive trip/user/company data

---

## Summary

Two related **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** vulnerabilities were discovered in the TripActions/Navan staging API.

1. **Booking Manipulation:**  
    An authenticated user can create bookings for other users by supplying their `uuid` in the `passengerData` field when calling the booking endpoint. No ownership or delegation checks are enforced.
    
2. **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  
    An authenticated user can access sensitive trip, user, and company details for other users by requesting `/api/admin/trips/{uuid}`. The response includes personal identifiers, trip details, company office addresses, geo coordinates, and internal configuration flags.
    

These vulnerabilities expose PII, financial data, and company metadata, and allow unauthorized bookings to be made in the name of another user.

---

## Affected Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/trip/hotel/searches/{searchUuid}/contracts/{contractUuid}/book/streaming`
    
- `GET /api/admin/trips/{tripUuid}`

## Proof of Concept (Sanitized)

### 1. Booking on Behalf of Another User

**Request:**

```http
POST /api/v1/trip/hotel/searches/<searchUuid>/contracts/<contractUuid>/book/streaming?paymentMethodUuid=<paymentUuid>&tripId=NEW&tripName=Escaldes-Engordany%20Trip
Authorization: TripActions <REDACTED_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "passengerData":[
    {
      "passenger": {
        "uuid": "12a510a9-4f9b-43b6-96ea-1a548c95642f",
        "givenName": "Test",
        "familyName": "Testy"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected:** Server rejects booking creation when the passenger UUID does not match the requesting user (403 Forbidden).  
**Observed:** Booking created successfully for the victim user.

### 2. Unauthorized Access to Trip Data

**Request:**

```http
GET /api/admin/trips/3f363203-860f-448b-85c8-2302e93ca0b7
Authorization: TripActions <REDACTED_TOKEN>
```

**Response (excerpt):**

```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "+1-202-555-0199",
    "companyName": "TripActions",
    "companyOfficeLocation": {
      "formattedAddress": "3045 Park Blvd, Palo Alto, CA 94306, USA",
      "geo": {
        "latitude": 37.4257341,
        "longitude": -122.1371254
      }
    }
  },
  "tripPassengers": [
    {
      "uuid": "12a510a9-4f9b-43b6-96ea-1a548c95642f",
      "givenName": "Test",
      "familyName": "Testy"
    }
  ],
  "dateSignUpCompleted": "2025-09-19T20:24:52.730978Z"
}
```

## Impact

- **Confidentiality:** Full leakage of personal details (emails, phone numbers, names), company office addresses with GPS coordinates, and user account metadata.
    
- **Integrity:** Unauthorized bookings/cancellations can be made in the name of another user, potentially leading to financial loss.
    
- **Availability:** Fraudulent bookings could lock user accounts or consume resources.
    
- **Business Risk:** PII and sensitive business travel data could be weaponized for phishing, fraud, corporate espionage, or doxxing.

## Recommended Remediation

1. **Authorization Checks:**
    
    - Validate that `passenger.uuid == requesting_user.uuid` unless explicit delegation exists.
        
    - Restrict `/api/admin/trips/{id}` to admins or the resource owner only.
        
2. **Data Minimization:**
    
    - Do not return internal flags, geo-coordinates, or sensitive user data to non-admins.
        
    - Mask emails and phone numbers when not strictly required.
        
3. **Monitoring & Logging:**
    
    - Add alerts for mismatched UUIDs in booking attempts.
        
    - Log and audit all admin endpoint calls.
        
4. **Token & Access Control:**
    
    - Rotate staging/production tokens.
        
    - Limit staging API exposure to authorized staff.

## Suggested Timeline

- **Immediate (24h):** Disable vulnerable endpoints or restrict access.
    
- **Within 7 days:** Deploy fixes and regression tests.
    
- **Within 30 days:** Audit logs, rotate keys, and notify affected users if applicable.

- **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network (HTTP API).
    
- **AC:L (Low):** No special conditions or complex steps are required — change UUIDs and send requests.
    
- **PR:L (Low):** Requires an authenticated user token (low privilege; not admin).
    
- **UI:N (None):** No user interaction required beyond the attacker sending requests.
    
- **S:U (Scope Unchanged):** The vulnerability affects resources within the same security scope (the API/tenant) — authorization checks missing, but impact is constrained to existing resources.
    
- **C:H / I:H / A:H (High):**
    
    - **Confidentiality High:** Full PII (email, phone, company, office geo coordinates) is exposed.
        
    - **Integrity High:** Attacker can create bookings on behalf of other users (unauthorized actions).
        
    - **Availability High:** Fraudulent bookings or cancellations could cause service disruption/denial of service to legitimate users or financial loss.
